Future plans:
	- apply different html class to tests that succeed/failed
	- implement tabs to switch view of testcase list
	- implement testing of exceptions
	- implmenent timer to prevent accidental infinite loop stalling the entire program
	- layout each testcase result as row for table
	- have a testpage for each practicefile
	- find a way to reuse the testpage for each practice file
	- modularize my js files

DONE:
